## Feature architectural contract

All features must follow this structure:

- `pages/` is **always required** — even for static features
- `{feature}_view/` is added when there are reusable sub-widgets beyond the page itself
- `domain/bloc/` and `repository/` are added only when the feature has its own state or data layer
- Features that read from global blocs (e.g. `LanguageBloc`) do **not** need their own domain layer

## Routes (current)
| RouteEnum | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| home | / | Hero image from Firestore |
| pieces | /pieces | Individual pottery items |
| categories | /categories | Products by category |
| collections | /collections | Products by collection |
| contact | /contact | Contact info |
| designs | /designs | Pottery designs |

Commented-out (not active): `story`

## Singletons (registered in service_locator.dart)
| Type | Kind | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `LanguageBloc` | BLoC | Runtime language toggle (pure UI state) |
| `HomeBloc` | BLoC | Fetch home page image filename from Firestore |
| `PiecesBloc` | BLoC | Hold shaped pieces + designs data for the Pieces route |
| `DesignsBloc` | BLoC | Hold shaped designs data for the Designs route |
| `CategoriesBloc` | BLoC | Hold shaped categories + designs data for the Categories route |
| `CollectionsBloc` | BLoC | Hold shaped collections + designs data for the Collections route |
| `ScrollPositionCache` | plain class | Key→offset map for scroll restoration; never drives rebuilds |

Feature BLoCs use `Bloc<AppBlocEvent, XxxState>` so the shared `BlocStatusChanged` event (defined in `core/state/app_bloc_event.dart`) can be dispatched to any of them. Each feature's own event class (e.g. `PiecesEvent`) still extends `AppBlocEvent` and is re-exported from the feature's event file.

BLoCs are seeded with initial events in `service_locator.dart` and exposed to the widget tree via `MultiBlocProvider` in `App`.

## Back navigation
Detail routes (e.g. `/pieces/:id`, `/categories/:id`) are pushed via go_router's `.push()`, which maintains a proper browser history stack. `AppBarLeftActions` detects detail routes via `GoRouterState.of(context).pathParameters.containsKey('id')` and calls `GoRouter.of(context).pop()` — no custom history stack needed.

## Data flow
```
Firestore → CloudService → ProductsRepository (shared cache) → FeatureRepository → FeatureBloc → Widget
```

`ProductsRepository` fetches all Firestore collections once and caches the result as an `AllProductsData` record. Feature repositories receive it, extract and shape their slice of the data, and return it to their bloc.

`HomeRepository` fetches independently from `CloudService` (home page data is unrelated to product data).

## Localization
- All user-visible strings are keyed by `Translation` enum.
- Add a new string: add to enum, then add to `en.dart` and `fi.dart`.
- `validate_translations.dart` catches missing keys at test time.

## Code generation
Run after changing freezed models or go_router routes:
```
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```
