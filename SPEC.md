# SPEC.md — Tsirbunen Pottery App

## Purpose
A public-facing web app where the owner showcases pottery items for people to browse on the internet. Future: purchasing pottery items directly through the app.

- **Owner** (future): Manage product listings via Firestore directly.
- **Buyers** (future): Purchase pottery items through the app.

## Current Features

### Browse pottery
Visitors can navigate to:

- **Pieces** — list/grid of individual pottery pieces.
- **Categories** — pottery grouped by category.
- **Collections** — pottery grouped by collection.
- **Designs** — pottery designs.
- **Contact** — how to reach the owner.

### Localization

- Language is toggled at runtime via `GeneralStateBloc`.
